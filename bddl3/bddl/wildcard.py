"""Wildcard expansion for BDDL problem files.

Some BDDL problem files use ``*`` in instance names (e.g.
``cabinet.n.01_*``) to mean "match as many scene objects of this type as
exist in the given room." The number of expanded instances is a property
of the environment, not the task.

:func:`expand_wildcards` takes a raw BDDL string and a scene layout dict,
and returns an expanded BDDL string with wildcards replaced by concrete
numbered instances.
